# Batrium-NodeRed-for-Home-Assistant
My Node-Red flow for Batrium in Home Assistant.

Requires Home Assistant Node-Red configuration to include: 
npm_packages:
  - binary-parser


Also /config/node-red/settings.js should have the functionsGlobalContext section filled out with the settings.js settings from this file.
Use the Home Assistant file editor to edit your file to match.
