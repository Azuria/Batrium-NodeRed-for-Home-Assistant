# Batrium-NodeRed-for-Home-Assistant
My Node-Red flow for Batrium in Home Assistant.

In Add-on settings for Node-Red configuration, add the NPM as shown in configuration.yaml.


Also /config/node-red/settings.js should have the functionsGlobalContext section filled out with the settings.js file example.
Use the Home Assistant file editor to edit your file to match.
